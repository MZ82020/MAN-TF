# Geometry-Aware Deep Learning for 3D Skeleton-Based Motion Prediction

## Overview

In this paper, we propose a novel approach, MAN-TF, which combines Kendall's shape space with Lie group representations and transformers for accurate body movement characterization, with a focus on improving long-term prediction accuracy. 
In doing so, we model both rigid and non rigid transformations of the skeletons involved in human motion for smooth and plausible predictions in long-term horizons.
